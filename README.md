# Predicting-Course-Modality-Choice

#### Why are face-to-face students choosing to take online courses?

At Arizona State University, there exist online courses made specifically for
on-ground/in-person students. They are called iCourses and stand alone from ASUOnline
course offerings.

iCourses are available in most departments on campus and can satisfy both
elective credit and core credit requirements, depending on the degree program.

Students may elect to take iCourses for a variety of reasons - scheduling, perceived
difficulty, individual interest, etc., but few have investigated the mechanisms behind
this choice. This project is an attempt to uncover reasons why students choose
to take iCourses over equivalent in-person courses.

#### Outline

1. Preliminary investigation:
    * A relatively quick investigation of the data in order to grasp the landscape. What kind of courses exist? Who takes these courses? Etc.
    * Findings are summarized in the "Preliminary Investigation" pdf file

2. Course choice modeling:
    * Can we predict the likelihood of someone taking an iCourse?
    * What factors are important in this decision?

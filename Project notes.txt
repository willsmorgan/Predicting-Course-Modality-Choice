iCourse Project Layout/Objectives

initial investigation:
    - which kind of courses are offered?
    - who is taking them?
    - who offers them?


course choice model:
    - can we predict the likelihood of someone taking an iCourse?
    - what factors influence a student's decision to take an iCourse?
        - class size
        - level
        - availability (what if there is only one modality offered in a given term?)

grade differences
